pacparser uses SpiderMonkey JavaScript library to parse and interpret
JavaScript in PAC files. You will need to install SM javascript library and
headers to be able to compile and use pacparser.

On a Debian based (including Ubuntu) system:
-------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get install libmozjs-dev


On a RPM based system (e.g. Fedora, Redhat):
-------------------------------------------
$ yum install js-devel


On Mac OS X:
------------
On Mac you'll need to install Xcode[1] and MacPorts[2]. If MacPorts is
already installed, ensure that it's up to date and install spidermonkey library
using it.

$ sudo port selfupdate
$ sudo port sync
$ sudo port install spidermonkey


On other Unix like system:
-------------------------
$ sudo spidermonkey/install_sm.sh

This script downloads spidermonkey source code from mozilla website, compiles
it and installs it.
