Installing pacparser from Source Code:
=====================================

You can download latest pacparser source code tarball from:
  http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/downloads/list.

You can also get the latest source code from subversion (svn) repository by
following instructions at:
  http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/source

pacparser uses SpiderMonkey JavaScript (JS) interpreter to parse PAC files. So,
we need to get SpiderMonkey JS interpreter first.

Installing SpiderMonkey JS Interpreter:
--------------------------------------
  There are packages available for Ubuntu and Debian. For other systems, you
  can compile it from sources.

  * From packages:
      For Debian and Ubuntu edgy+ (6.10+): libmozjs0d and libmozjs-dev.
      => sudo apt-get install libmozjs0d libmozjs-dev
      For Ubuntu dapper and earlier (6.06-): libsmjs1 and libsmjs-dev.
      => sudo apt-get install libsmjs1 libsmjs-dev

  * By compiling from source:
      SpiderMonkey JS interpreter is included with pacparser source code, and can
      be compiled and installed by running following:
      => make js
      => sudo make install-js

Compiling and Installing pacparser:
----------------------------------
  Once you have SpiderMonkey JS interpreter, compiling and installing pacparser is
  as easy as running following:
     => make
     => sudo make install

On Win-32 Systems:

Binary Distribution:
===================

Compiled packages for win32 systems can be downloaded from:
http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/downloads/list

To install it, just extract the files and copy them to somewhere on your system
path, e.g. C:\Windows, C:\Windows\system32 or your program's working directory.

Compiling from Source Code:
==========================

Compiling pacparser for Windows is a rather involved process and is documented
in detail in README.win32 file included with this package.
