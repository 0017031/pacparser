Installing pacparser from Source Code:
=====================================

You can download latest pacparser source code tarball from:
  http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/downloads/list.

You can also get the latest source code from subversion (svn) repository by
following instructions at:
  http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/source

pacparser uses SpiderMonkey JavaScript (JS) interpreter to parse PAC files. So,
we need to get SpiderMonkey JS interpreter first.

Installing SpiderMonkey JS Interpreter:
--------------------------------------
  There are packages available for Ubuntu and Debian. For other systems, you
  can compile it from sources.

  * From packages:
      For Debian and Ubuntu edgy+ (6.10+): libmozjs0d and libmozjs-dev.
      => sudo apt-get install libmozjs0d libmozjs-dev
      For Ubuntu dapper and earlier (6.06-): libsmjs1 and libsmjs-dev.
      => sudo apt-get install libsmjs1 libsmjs-dev

  * By compiling from source:
      SpiderMonkey JS interpreter is included with pacparser source code, and can
      be compiled and installed by running following:
      => make js
      => sudo make install-js

Compiling and Installing pacparser:
----------------------------------
  Once you have SpiderMonkey JS interpreter, compiling and installing pacparser is
  as easy as running following:
     => make
     => sudo make install

On Win-32 Systems:

Binary Distribution:
===================

Compiled packages for win32 systems (pacparser-v.v.v-win32.zip) can be
downloaded from:
http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/downloads/list

To install it, just extract it somewhere. It will create a directory -
"pacparser". Your system should be able to find DLLs inside this directory.
There are two ways to achieve that - either you can add pacparser directory to
your system path or, you can execute programs from this directory i.e. with
this directory as your current working directory.

Compiling from Source Code:
==========================

Compiling pacparser for Windows is a rather involved process and is documented
in detail in README.win32 file included with this package.
