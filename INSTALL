You can download latest pacparser source code tarball from:
  http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/downloads/list.

You can also get the latest source code from subversion (svn) repository by
following instructions at:
  http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/source

pacparser uses SpiderMonkey JavaScript (JS) engine to parse PAC files. So, we
need to get SpiderMonkey JS engine first.

* Installing SpiderMonkey JS Engine (required to build and use pacparser):
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  There are packages available for Ubuntu and Debian. For other systems, you
  can compile it from sources.

  * From packages:
      For Debian and Ubuntu edgy+ (6.10+): libmozjs0d and libmozjs-dev.
      => sudo apt-get install libmozjs0d libmozjs-dev
      For Ubuntu dapper and earlier (6.06-): libsmjs1 and libsmjs-dev.
      => sudo apt-get install libsmjs1 libsmjs-dev

  * By compiling from source:
      SpiderMonkey JS engine is included with pacparser source code, and can
      be compiled and installed by running following:
      => make js
      => sudo make install-js

* pacparser C library:
  ----------------------------------
  Once you have SpiderMonkey JS engine, compiling and installing pacparser is
  as easy as running following:
     => make
     => sudo make install

* pacparser python module:
  ------------------------------------------------
  To compile and install pacparser python module:
    => make pymod
    => make install-pymod

On Win-32 Systems:

Binary Distribution:
===================

Compiled packages for win32 systems can be downloaded from:
http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/downloads/list

* C Library:
  ---------
To install pacparser C library, download package pacparser-v.v.v-win32.zip and
extract it somewhere on your machine. It will create a directory -
"pacparser-v.v.v". Copy all the DLLs in the directory to somewhere on the
system where system can find them while executing your program (application's
executable's location will do fine for this purpose) or simply add pacparser
directory to system path. You'll need libpacparser.a and pacparser.lib to link
in pacparser on mingw compiler tools and Visual Studio respectively. Here are
the detailed instructions to link in pacparser on Visual Studio:
http://code.google.com/p/pacparser/wiki/LinkingOnVisualStudio.

* Python Module
  -------------
To install pacparser python module (available only for Python 2.5 right now),
download package pacparser-python25-v.v.v-win32.zip and extract it somewhere
on your system. On command prompt (cmd), change directory to
pacparser-python25-v.v.v-win32 and execute "setup.py install". If it fails for
some reason, simply copy all the files from this directory to
C:\Python25\Lib\site-packages\pacparser and you are done.

Compiling from Source Code:
==========================

Compiling pacparser for Windows is a rather involved process and is documented
in detail in README.win32 file included with this package.
